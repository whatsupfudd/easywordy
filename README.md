# Easy Wordy

The EasyWordy project provides an evolution path out of WordPress into more advanced and secure web site applications and content presentation.

It is achieved by embedding a PHP interpreter into a highly verifiable web server.  The web server itself is based on the Servant package, and it is developed using the Haskell language.

The core functionality of Wordpress is re-implemented in Haskell, which provide a base on which Wordpress themes and plugins can be added just like in the conventional Wordpress.  This enables current Wordpress users to do a no-effort dropin of **EasyWordy** into their environment and then start using more powerful and less error-prone logic to evolve their web site.
